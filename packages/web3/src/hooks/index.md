# Hooks

Expose some commonly used Hooks that you can use independently or in conjunction with components.

## useConnection

Connect or disconnect the wallet. Usually, you don't need to use this Hook directly, but use the [Connector](../connector/index.md) component. This Hook is used when you need to connect or disconnect the wallet in custom components or event triggers.

### Examples

The following example simulates the connection through `Web3ConfigProvider`. Usually, your application will use [adapter](../../../../docs/guide/adapter.md), so you don't need to do this like the example, but use `useConnection` directly.

<code src="./demos/useConnection.tsx"></code>
